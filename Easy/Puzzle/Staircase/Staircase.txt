Question
    Consider a staircase of size n = 4:
           #
          ##
         ###
        ####

    Observe that its base and height are both equal to , and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
        Write a program that prints a staircase of size n

    Function Description
        Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase as described above.
        staircase has the following parameter(s):
            - n: an integer

    Input Format
        A single integer, n, denoting the size of the staircase.

    Constraints
        0 < n <= 100

    Output Format
        Print a staircase of size using # symbols and spaces.
        Note: The last line must have 0 spaces in it.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - In the first row, we will have n - 1 zeros and 1 '#'
        - As we move downward
            - We will decrement the number of zeros and increment the number of '#'
        - When the number of '#' reaches 'n', we will stop the iteration

Answer
    - Iterate through the indices from 1 -> n, denoted as 'i'
        - Create a StringBuilder 'pound' to keep track of all the '#'
        - Iterate through from 0 -> 'i - 1'
            - Append '#' to 'pound'
        - Using String.format() to prepend spaces in front of our string 'pound'
            - We want our string to take up exactly n spaces
            - Any extra space will be prepended
        - Print the formatted string
        - If 'i' is not equal to 'n'
            - print a new line
