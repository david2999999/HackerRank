Question
    You are working at the cash counter at a fun-fair, and you have different types of coins available to you in infinite quantities. The value of each coin is already given.
    Can you determine the number of ways of making change for a particular number of units using the given types of coins?

    Function Description
        Complete the getWays function in the editor below. It must return an integer denoting the number of ways to make change.

        getWays has the following parameter(s):
            - n: an integer, the amount to make change for
            - c: an array of integers representing available denominations

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Lets convert the top down memoization approach to a bottom up approach
        - Where do we start?
            - In the memoization approach
                - We have cached 'i,n' with 'ways'
            - This means we can create a 2D matrix 'ways' to keep track of the ways for all combination of 'i, n'
