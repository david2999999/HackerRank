Question
    In this challenge, you will be given an array B and must determine an array A.
    There is a special rule: For all i, A[i] <= B[i]. That is, A[i] can be any number you choose such that 1 <= A[i] <= B[i].
    Your task is to select a series of A[i] given B[i]such that the sum of the absolute difference of consecutive pairs of A is maximized.
    This will be the array's cost, and will be represented by the variable S below.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - The recursive approach is inefficient due to overlapping recursive calls
        - We can avoid overlapping recursive calls using memoization
    - What do we need to cache?
        - In each of the recursive call
            - We are trying to find the 'maxSum' at each 'i, prev'
            - This means we can cache 'i,prev' with 'maxSum'
